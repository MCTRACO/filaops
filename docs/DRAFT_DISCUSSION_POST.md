## Title: 🚀 Docker Deployment is Here + We Want Your Feedback!

Hey everyone,

I've noticed quite a few of you have cloned FilaOps (117 unique clones!) - thank you for checking it out!

### Docker Deployment Now Available

Based on feedback, I've added **one-command Docker deployment**. No more installing Python, Node, SQL Server separately.

```bash
git pull                    # Get latest
docker-compose up -d        # Start everything
# Open http://localhost:5173
```

That's it. Database, backend, frontend - all containerized.

See the new [INSTALL.md](../INSTALL.md) for full instructions.

### Quick Questions for Early Adopters

If you've tried FilaOps, I'd love to hear:

1. **Did you get it running?** If not, what blocked you?
2. **What's your setup?** (# of printers, current workflow)
3. **What features matter most?** MRP? Inventory? Bambu integration?

Drop a comment below or use the Feedback discussion template.

### What's Next

- Squashing bugs reported by early users
- Performance improvements (dashboard MRP caching)
- YouTube walkthrough video

Thanks for being early adopters. Your feedback shapes the roadmap.
