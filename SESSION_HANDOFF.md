## Last Updated

**Date:** December 5, 2025 (Session 4)
**Session Summary:** FilaOps public repo live on GitHub with clean history

## CRITICAL BUSINESS CONTEXT

### Three Repositories Work Together

```
C:\Users\brand\OneDrive\Documents\blb3d-erp       → ERP Backend (port 8000)
C:\Users\brand\OneDrive\Documents\quote-portal    → Customer + Admin UI (port 5173)
C:\Users\brand\OneDrive\Documents\bambu-print-suite → ML Dashboard (port 8001)
```

**IMPORTANT:**

- Admin UI is at `localhost:5173/admin` (quote-portal), NOT the ML Dashboard
- ML Dashboard reads from ERP via `/api/v1/internal/*` endpoints
- All three repos need to stay in sync

### Revenue-Critical Integrations NOT YET BUILT

| Integration | Why It Matters | Status |
|-------------|----------------|--------|
| **Squarespace** | 80%+ of revenue comes from here. Orders must sync to ERP. | NOT STARTED |
| **QuickBooks** | Accounting compliance. Invoices/payments must sync. | NOT STARTED |
| **B2B Parts Portal** | Retail partners need wholesale ordering | NOT STARTED |

### Current Payment/Shipping Status

- **Stripe**: Works but in TEST MODE only
- **EasyPost**: Works but in TEST MODE only
- Need production API keys before go-live

## HOW TO PREVENT CONTEXT LOSS

### For the Human

1. **At session start**: Tell the AI to read `SESSION_HANDOFF.md` and `AI_CONTEXT.md`
2. **During session**: If discussing something important, ask AI to update these docs
3. **At session end**: Ask AI to update this file with what was done

### For the AI

1. **Always read** `AI_CONTEXT.md` → Integration Roadmap section
2. **Always read** this file (`SESSION_HANDOFF.md`)
3. **Update this file** at the end of every session
4. **Commit changes** before session ends to preserve work
