## Critical Issues

### ISSUE-001: Production-to-Shipping Transaction Tracking (0 Records)

**Status:** Open
**Priority:** Critical
**Reported:** 2025-01-19
**Affects:** Transaction audit trail, accounting reconciliation

**Description:**
The system records 0 transactions from production to shipping. When items move through the fulfillment process (production complete → shipped), no transaction records are being created.

**Expected Behavior:**
- When production is completed, a transaction should record inventory movement
- When items are shipped, a shipping event should be recorded
- These should be queryable for audit/accounting purposes

**Actual Behavior:**
- No transaction records exist
- `SELECT * FROM transactions` returns 0 rows (or no shipping-related records)

**Files to Investigate:**
- `backend/app/services/shipping_service.py` - Shipping logic
- `backend/app/services/transaction_audit_service.py` - Transaction recording
- `backend/app/models/shipping_event.py` - Shipping event model
- `backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/admin/fulfillment.py` - Fulfillment endpoints
- `backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/admin/inventory_transactions.py` - Transaction endpoints

**Investigation Steps:**
1. Check if transaction table exists in schema
2. Trace the shipping flow: where should transactions be created?
3. Check if shipping_service.py calls transaction_audit_service
4. Look for missing database commits or exception swallowing

**Root Cause:** IDENTIFIED - Missing Shipment Transaction in Fulfillment Flow

After investigation, the issue is in [backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/admin/fulfillment.py](backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/admin/fulfillment.py):

**The Flow:**
1. `start_production()` - Creates `reservation` transactions for materials ✓
2. `complete_print()` - Creates `consumption` (materials) + `receipt` (finished goods) ✓
3. `pass_qc()` - Status update only (correct - no inventory change)
4. `buy_label()` - Consumes packaging BUT **does NOT create shipment transaction** ✗
5. `mark_order_shipped()` - **Does NOT create ANY inventory transactions** ✗

**The Bug:**
When finished goods are produced (`complete_print()`), they are added to inventory via a `receipt` transaction. But when they are shipped (`buy_label()` or `mark_order_shipped()`), no `shipment` transaction is created to remove them from inventory.

**Result:**
- Finished goods accumulate in inventory forever (never decremented)
- No audit trail for shipped items
- Inventory quantities become incorrect over time
- Accounting cannot reconcile sales vs inventory

**Code Locations:**
- `buy_label()` line 1756-1915: Consumes packaging, but missing finished goods shipment
- `mark_order_shipped()` line 1918-1968: No inventory transactions at all

**Fix:**
Add `shipment` type `InventoryTransaction` in both `buy_label()` and `mark_order_shipped()` to:
1. Decrement finished goods `on_hand_quantity` in `Inventory` table
2. Create `shipment` transaction with `reference_type='sales_order'`

**Example Fix (for buy_label, around line 1872):**
```python
# After packaging consumption, ALSO ship the finished goods
if order.quote_id:
    quote = db.query(Quote).filter(Quote.id == order.quote_id).first()
    if quote and quote.product_id:
        fg_inventory = db.query(Inventory).filter(
            Inventory.product_id == quote.product_id
        ).first()
        if fg_inventory:
            qty_shipped = order.quantity or 1
            fg_inventory.on_hand_quantity = Decimal(str(
                max(0, float(fg_inventory.on_hand_quantity) - qty_shipped)
            ))
            shipment_txn = InventoryTransaction(
                product_id=quote.product_id,
                location_id=fg_inventory.location_id,
                transaction_type="shipment",
                reference_type="sales_order",
                reference_id=sales_order_id,
                quantity=Decimal(str(-qty_shipped)),
                notes=f"Shipped {qty_shipped} units for {order.order_number}",
                created_by="system",
            )
            db.add(shipment_txn)
```
